# periodic-table-quiz
This app is a JavaScript-based quiz to help students learn the elements and symbols of the periodic table.
It is easy to play: simply copy and paste the code in Quiz.js into the console of a browser with the developer tools open (ctrl + shift + i in windows) and then call the function welcome(). This repo is also a good resource for developers looking to write their own periodic table code as it has the full library of key/value pairs of elements and symbols in the Quiz.js file.
